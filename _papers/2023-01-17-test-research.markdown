description: "<p>Proof systems evolution brought a wide variety of ways to provide a short description of a computation
performed. Each of them brings different trade-offs between proving time, proof size, verification
complexity, absence or presence of a zero-knowledge properties, recursion friendliness in the various
forms of trade-offs, putting all the same components together in a different way.</p>
<p>This paper introduces a proof system called Placeholder focused on providing the most compact
circuit representation along with the cheapest verification within different environments (register-based
executors, certain stack-based executors). This is achieved by adjusting arithmetization methods,
commitment schemes, verification process commitments handling way and switching in-recursion layers
proof sub-systems components themselves.</p>"
